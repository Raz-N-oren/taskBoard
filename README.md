# taskBoard

First project as a student at "John Bryce". 
This project is based on JavaScript with fine detailed HTML & CSS. 
The Task-Board Project consists of an online task board in which one can add or delete personal future tasks or responsibilities. 
Each task's data is saved within each computer's local storage.
